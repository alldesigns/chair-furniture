<p><strong>Adaptive Reuse Design</strong>, This is why many of us in the design and construction industry are increasingly focused on adaptive reuse a rehabilitation technique that maintains the character and structure of a building. Adaptive Reuse is a way to save a neglected building that might otherwise be demolished. Its repurposing an existing space that has outlived the original purpose into new and innovative uses while at the same time retaining historic features.</p>

<p>The term Adaptive Reuse implies a change in use and occupancy or the rehabilitation of a previously unoccupied site space or building before reuse and occupancy. Adaptive reuse refers to the process of reusing an existing building for a purpose other than which it was originally built or designed for. Adaptive reuse especially in urban environments is a way of providing environmentally responsive design that creates a strong sense of place and authenticity and enhances the value of buildings and amenities. Adaptive reuse of heritage buildings refers to repurposing or reusing an existing structure for a completely different purpose than what it was intended for.
