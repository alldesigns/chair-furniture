Anesthesia in the sitting position9 At the present time two critical questions about blood pressure management in the BCP are actively being debated. The systemic arterial blood pressure BP must be increased to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion.

<p>In patients who are anesthetized for surgery in the beach chair position brain blood pressure can fall to levels below the brains ability to autoregulate. In any upright position including the beach chair position the blood pressure BP measured in the arm will be higher than the BP in the brain.

<p>The beach chair position that is commonly used in shoulder surgery is associated with relative hypovolemia which leads to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. The beach chair position BCP during shoulder arthroscopy is a known risk factor for cerebral ischemia.
