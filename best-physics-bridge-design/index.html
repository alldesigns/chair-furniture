<p>Therefore it became very popular and was considered one of the best designs for railroad bridges back in the day. I was really surprised. It is also interesting to see that different bridge designs are suitable for different terrains. I had never even come close to getting this amount of strength out of a bridge design before.

<p>I built this bridge for the 2005 Fernbank Science Center bridge design event. This makes the bridge much more compact and all aspects of the bridge especially joints will be bound together with more strength. Some physics concepts that are considered when bridges are designed are compression and tension. They work in tandem like a regular truss with struts that connect the upper arches to the lower archs.

<p>The way you design it is important because your bridge should have a proper balance while at the same time being sufficiently strong. A beam bridge can take great weight over a short distance truss bridges take advantage of the strength of the shape of a triangle while suspension bridges can handle torque and tension across a long distance. Advanced bridges are usually focused on designs based on arched cantilever and bowstring bridges. A beam bridge needs to be stiff. Structure Panosundaki Pin.</p>
