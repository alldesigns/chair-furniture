<p><strong>Beach Chair Position And Anesthesia</strong>, The aim of this study was to assess the impact of intravenous general anesthesia and controlled hypotension on cerebral saturation rScO 2 cerebral blood flow measured as middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity Vmax MCA and neurobehavioral outcome in patients scheduled for shoulder surgery in beach chair position. Antegrade nailing anterolateralanterior plating and external fixation may all be performed in the beach chair position. According to a report by Murphy et al3 shoulder surgery in the beach chair position was associated with a significant reduction in cerebral oxygenation.</p>

<p>Side Effects of the Beach Chair Position Open shoulder surgery or arthroscopy performed in the sitting position under interscalene block may be complicated by episodes of bradycardia or hypotension or both which occurs in up to 20 of cases. There are no published data pertaining to changes in cerebral oxygenation seen with increases in the inspired oxygen fraction or end-tidal carbon dioxide in patients anesthetized in the beach chair position. Hence while doing shoulder surgery in an upright position if a blood pressure reading for a cuff placed at the level of the heart is 12080 mmHg and there is 25 cm of elevation between it and the external auditory meatus the cerebral pressure is 10262. Antegrade nailing anterolateralanterior plating and external fixation may all be performed in the beach chair position.</p>

<p>The beach chair position is a reliable safe and effective position to perform nearly all types of shoulder arthroscopic procedures. After the induction of anesthesia patients were put into the beach-chair position using a beach-chair table T-MAX beach chair. Under general anesthesia the beach chair position does not alter cerebral oxygenation in patients showing normal preoperative cerebral TOI values. We hypothesize that the incidence of CDEs with general anesthesia in beach chair position would be first in the range of 2080 as previously determined and second that CDEs would correlate with cerebral blood flow impairment and neurobehavioral decline.

The advantages of the beach chair position include the ease of setup limited brachial plexus stress increased glenohumeral and subacromial visualization anesthesia flexibility and the ability to easily convert to an open procedure. After the induction of anesthesia patients were put into the beach-chair position using a beach-chair table T-MAX beach chair. Hence while doing shoulder surgery in an upright position if a blood pressure reading for a cuff placed at the level of the heart is 12080 mmHg and there is 25 cm of elevation between it and the external auditory meatus the cerebral pressure is 10262.

<p>It is helpful to place the trunk almost upright with an almost hanging arm to help reduce the fracture by ligamentotaxis and gravity. Beach chair positioning during general anesthesia is associated with a high incidence of cerebral desaturation. 1 2 This position affords better intra-articular visualization and less risk of neurovascular trauma than when patients are placed in the lateral decubitus position LDP. 1 In 2005 Pohl and Cullen published a 4-patient case series describing catastrophic cerebral ischemia in patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the BCP.

<p>Reduced cerebral perfusion seems to occur frequently during shoulder surgery in the beach chair position BCP primarily in patients under general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation which may be magnified by deliberate hypotension. It is helpful to place the trunk almost upright with an almost hanging arm to help reduce the fracture by ligamentotaxis and gravity. 1 2 This position affords better intra-articular visualization and less risk of neurovascular trauma than when patients are placed in the lateral decubitus position LDP. There are no published data pertaining to changes in cerebral oxygenation seen with increases in the inspired oxygen fraction or end-tidal carbon dioxide in patients anesthetized in the beach chair position.
