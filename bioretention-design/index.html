<p><strong>Bioretention Design</strong>, When properly planned bioretention cells can be part of your attractive landscape. To this end designers may choose to go with the baseline design Level 1 or choose an enhanced design Level 2 that maximizes nutrient and runoff reduction.

<p>The basic design parameters for bioretention systems are its storage volume the thickness character and permeability rate of its planting soil bed and either the hydraulic capacity of its underdrain or the permeability of its subsoil whichever is applicable. Cells designed for bioretention can manage the stormwater runoff from large areas of impervious surface. For colder climate detail refer to State of Minnesota Stormwater Manual-2005. The table below describes some recommended values to use to begin the design process.</p>

Bioretention fed by overland flow and curb notches is an on-line BMP and filter strip gravel and vegetation should be designed to withstand flow velocities from the 15-year 20-minute design storm. Hydrologic Design Criteria Bioretention facilities can be designed to meet Minimum Requirement 6 Runoff. More information on soil media can be found. Confirm design assumptions from steps 2 and 4 and finalize the site plan for use in project permitting. The table below describes some recommended values to use to begin the design process.</p>
