<p>This design is more effective than the Radial Brake at reducing felt recoil but directs a greater blast back towards the shooter from the angled side ports. Due to the design the harder the muzzle brake is pushed the more effective it becomes. It should be able to take a lot of beating and withstand prolonged rapid firing. Im not trying to pimp my breaks but if you want the best recoil reduction get a baffle designed brake. Pin On Armas.</p>
