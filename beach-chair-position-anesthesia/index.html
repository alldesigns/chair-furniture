<p>The current study was designed to evaluate whether the beach chair position before and during general anesthesia differentially induces changes in cerebral oxygenation as determined by near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS in surgical patients. YES a change in position but is that scenario reimbursed any differently. A prospective study on the effect of general anesthesia compared with regional anesthesia and sedation. After the induction of anesthesia patients were put into the beach-chair position using a beach-chair table T-MAX beach chair.</p>
