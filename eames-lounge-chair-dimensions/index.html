<p>The classic dimensions are those of the original 1956 design. The eames lounge chair is 32.75” (83.2 cm) wide, 32.75” (83.2 cm) deep, with a back height of 31.5” (80 cm) and a seat height of 15” (38.1 cm). Conceived years after the famous plywood and fibreglass armchairs, the lounge chair was a gift for the eames’ close friend and director billy wilder. The lounge chair and ottoman are dated “ sep 13 1978”. Pin by Emmanuel Gee on Ergonomics Pinterest Rocking.</p>
