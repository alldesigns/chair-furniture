<p>100 steps to one iconic danish design — part of a series inspired by portraits of danish merchants in ming chairs, the wishbone chair is a true testament to craftsmanship. This original chair acquired its name due to the �y� wishbone shaped back and with its measured use of materials is a light, sculptural. Inspired by a portrait of danish merchants sitting in traditional ming chairs, this original design showcases the ergonomic sensibility that defines an antique. A rare combination of natural and practical, its misleadingly complex construction stems from the designer�s extensive knowledge of wood.
